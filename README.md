# PITS
A parts inventory tracking system -- or PITS -- designed to manage the location of parts and fixtures on off-site storage locations

# Program Goals
The aim of this program is to do the following:
* Enable users to add parts/fixtures with relevant ordering information to a database for ease of finding
* Enable users to create remote container locations where these parts/fixtures can be attributed as stored
* Allow users to update the location or the removal of parts from these storage locations for easy tracking

# Optimizations
This project is still in it's infancy and as such will still require the above goals to be met.
